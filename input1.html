If your scanner can correctly extract tags (with attributes) &#38; text,
&#59; remove comments and convert HTML coded symbols, 
find valid email: hello@world.com or not: ab@aaaaa
and valid phone numbers such as (123)123-1234 and 123-123-1234 but not 1234567890
you get full credit. 
Here are some links: http://insidecbu.calbaptist.edu and www.calbaptist.edu 
but not these: wwwedu or http.hello.com
You got all these then +10! If not study++!
